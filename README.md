### Hello there, I'm Manolis, commonly known as Overloaded! 👋
I am a co-founder and lead developer of [Orama Interactive](https://www.orama-interactive.com/), an indie game (and software, apparently) development team. I love [science and learning](https://github.com/OverloadedOrama/KnowledgeBase), games, art, animals, dreams, chocolate, automation, robots, life, the Universe. I do not love coffee, coffee is overrated. We're currently just a group of friends who dream of one day making Orama an actual company, and create content for a living.

One of the reasons I co-founded Orama Interactive is because I am a thinker and a dreamer, and I wanted a way to get my thoughts and creativity out to the world, and to make my dreams a reality. I also think that one of the best, if not the best, way to change and improve this world is through art and technology. And, well, games are a combination of both. So another reason I chose this path is to attempt to make this world a better place, from making content that is both fun and educational, to influence people's ways of thinking and promote open-mindedness. I hope you'll join me in this journey!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Pixelorama, a free an open source sprite editor](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama), made entirely with the Godot Engine!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Science at the University of Piraeus.
